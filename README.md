# Tesla Clone Project

A static HTML and CSS recreation of the Tesla.com homepage. This was a layout and styling exercise — built from scratch, without design files or templates — just by eyeballing the real site and coding what I saw.

## 🔗 Live Demo

> Coming soon on Netlify…

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (with Flexbox)

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to build a website from scratch without a design — just by studying a real website and translating it into code.
- Practiced spacing, layout, and alignment purely by visual reference.
- Improved my understanding of Flexbox for positioning and layout flow.
- Learned to trust the process, even when it felt messy or unclear.

## 🎯 Features

- Custom navigation bar
- Call-to-action buttons with hover effects
- Clean hero sections and text boxes
- Fully custom footer
- All layout built using **Flexbox** (no CSS Grid)

## 🔨 Future Improvements

- Make the layout responsive for smaller screens  
- Refactor code and improve structure  
- Continue building more layout projects for practice

## 🙋🏽‍♂️ Personal Note

I was honestly scared to build this.

I knew I wasn’t ready. But I also knew if I waited until I *felt* ready, I might never start. This project reminded me that action is what brings clarity — not waiting.

One section at a time. One mistake at a time. And now... it's done.
